# Sparnet--Smart-Grocery-Shopping-App
Sparnet is a mobile-first grocery shopping application designed to make everyday purchases faster, smarter, and more seamless.

Users can sign up using phone or email, verify their identity via OTP, and secure access with a 4-digit PIN. The app presents a personalized home feed with product recommendations and a dynamic product catalog powered by a backend service.

Sparnet supports barcode scanning to instantly fetch product details and add items to the cart. The cart system allows quantity adjustments, promo code discounts, automatic tax calculation, and secure payments through Stripe.

After a successful checkout, the app generates a downloadable PDF receipt, clears the cart, and completes the purchase flow smoothly. To add intelligence beyond shopping, Sparnet also suggests meals based on the items currently in the user’s cart.

This repository contains the MVP implementation focused on core shopping, payments, and user experience, serving as a strong foundation for future expansion such as loyalty programs, subscriptions, and AI-driven recommendations.
