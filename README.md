# Sparnet--Smart-Grocery-Shopping-App
Sparnet is a mobile-first grocery shopping app built to simplify how users discover, scan, and purchase everyday essentials.

The app enables secure sign-up via phone or email with OTP verification, followed by a 4-digit PIN for quick, secure access. Once logged in, users are greeted with a personalized home feed featuring product recommendations and a dynamic catalog powered by a backend service.

Sparnet supports barcode scanning to instantly fetch product details and add items to the cart. The cart experience includes quantity management, promo code discounts, automatic tax calculation, and secure checkout using Stripe.

After a successful payment, Sparnet generates a downloadable PDF receipt, clears the cart, and completes the transaction smoothly. To enhance the experience beyond shopping, the app also provides meal suggestions based on the items currently in the cart, helping users plan what to cook with what they buy.

This repository contains the MVP implementation, focused on core shopping workflows, payments, and a clean user experience, designed to scale into a full-featured smart grocery platform.
